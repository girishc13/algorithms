Writing interview questions hasn't made me rich. Maybe trading Apple stocks will.
I have an array stock_prices_yesterday where:

The indices are the time, as a number of minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
The values are the price of Apple stock at that time, in dollars.
For example, the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, so stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500.

Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday. For this problem, we won't allow "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell.
